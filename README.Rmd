<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of sctkr is to serve as a deposit for functions that perform common tasks for single cell analysis

## Installation

You can install the released version of sctkr from [github](https://github.com/Teichlab/sctkr) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Teichlab/sctkr")
```

## Usage example

A simple usage example is given below, for more options, look at `?CellTypeCompositionAnalysis` and `?plot_ranef`

``` r
result <- CellTypeCompositionAnalysis(
    obs_tbl,
    'sample_id',
    'my_annot',
    colVarCats=c(
        'Sex', 'Kit_version', 'Sample_location', 'Age_bin'
    )
)

print(plot_ranef(
    result$ranef,
    vars=list(
        Sample_location=c('Nose', 'Trachea', 'Bronchi'),
        Age_bin=c('Neonate', 'Infant', 'Young child', 'Child', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Eldly')
    ),
    maxFC=3
))
```

<!--
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(sctkr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
